ES 152 is a core course for electrical engineering concentrators at Harvard. The class covers core circuit theory principles (KCL, RLC, amplifiers) and the fundamentals of semiconductor devices (BJTs, MOSFETs, transistor circuits) with the goal of modeling, analyzing, and applying the analog behavior of devices. I had the pleasure of working with Professors Gage Hills and Woodward Yang.

### What I did:
* Ran office hours for the lab sessions - teaching students how to construct circuits and perform calculations for properly choosing circuit components.
* Graded labs and exams.

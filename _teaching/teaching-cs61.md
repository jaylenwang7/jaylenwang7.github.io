[CS 61](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/) is the introductory systems programming class at Harvard, normally with around 200 students enrolled. Main topics include: C, C++, and assembly language programming, performance analysis and improvement strategies, memory management, caching, concurrency, threads, and synchronization. The class is taught by Professor [Eddie Kohler](https://read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/) with around 15-20 teaching fellows every year (of which I'm one!).

Here's some of my favorite parts of the class:

### My favorite section to teach: [virtual memory](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2021/Section6/)!
I love page tables! It's a unique data structure that allows us to map a huge address range with relatively few pages. Also the idea of virtual memory, while a simple one, is extremely powerful. I love blowing students' minds with the idea of a virtaul and physical address space and that this conversion is actually done on hardware.

### My favorite problem set: [Shell](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2021/Shell/)!
While one of the most challenging of the assignments, it's also so cool to build your own functioning shell. Also I think in terms of software design it has the most interesting design decisions in terms of how you want to structure and parse your commands. Also I think being able to fork off subshells and commands is such a cool concept and really allows for students to get a more concrete idea of process creation.

ES 50 is the introductory electrical engineering class at Harvard. The class covers material ranging from introductory circuit design (resistor circuits, op amps, RLC) to digital logic (FSMs, boolean logic). 

### What I did (virtually):
* Ran office hours for helping students to work through the problem sets.
* Ran office hours for helping students with the labs - had a lot of fun debugging circuits virtually :).
* Graded psets, labs, and exams.

ES 155 is the introductory systems and control class at Harvard. The class covers topics ranging from system modeling (with state-space representation), to stability analysis, to feedback controller design (PID controllers). I had the pleasure of working with Professors Li Na and Yue Lu. 

### What I did (virtually):
* Ran office hours for the problem sets
* Attended classes to help facilitate discussion in breakout rooms and to help students work through in-class exercises

Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in [CMU's ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) program working with [Prof. Akshitha Sriraman](https://akshithasriraman.eecs.umich.edu/). I recently graduated from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) (Class of 2022), where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Welcome to my personal site! Feel free to click around to get to know me and see what I'm up to, and please do reach out if you have any questions about anything I've done.

What do I think is cool? (ie. research areas of interest)
======
* Computer architecture
* Hardware/software co-design
* Machine learning
* Cryptocurrency hardware
* Sustainable computing

What am I currently up to?
======
1. Enjoying the summer before entering my new PhD program (and trying to contain my excitement!)
2. Working on one of my main research projects relating to the resilience of DNN hardware to hardware faults.

Hobbies/interests
======
* I'm an avid tennis player and am currently the co-captain of the Harvard Club Tennis team. I've played competitively throughout high school and have made so many great friends along the way.
* I'm a big NBA fan, particularly of the Boston Celtics. While I don't always have time to watch all the Celtics games, I love keeping up with the players and what's going on around the league. If you have any NBA takes - I love a nice NBA-related discussion/debate :)
* I enjoy hiking, especially with my parents. Recently went hiking in the Rockies which was amazing!
* I love listening to podcasts and books, especially on topics related to history, tech, science, and food. Please give me book recs :)

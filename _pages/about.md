Hobbies/interests
======
* I'm an avid tennis player and am currently the co-captain of the Harvard Club Tennis team. I've played competitively throughout high school and have made so many great friends along the way.
* I'm a big NBA fan, particularly of the Boston Celtics. While I don't always have time to watch all the Celtics games, I love keeping up with the players and what's going on around the league. If you have any NBA takes - I love a nice NBA-related discussion/debate :)
* I enjoy hiking, especially with my parents. Recently went hiking in the Rockies which was amazing!
* I love listening to podcasts and books, especially on topics related to history, tech, science, and food. Please give me book recs :)

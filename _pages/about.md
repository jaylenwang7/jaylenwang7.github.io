Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student in [CMU's ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) program working with [Prof. Akshitha Sriraman](https://akshithasriraman.eecs.umich.edu/). My research passion lies in finding novel ways to make cloud/web systems more sustainable by targeting more efficient use of datacenter resources (particularly hardware) in order to reduce carbon emissions, e-waste, and other environmental impacts from hyperscale systems.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) (Class of 2022), where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

* I'm an avid tennis player, having played most of my life, through college (in club tennis), and still playing (when I can).

* I love cooking and all food content. May ask you questions such as "what fruit do you think is underrated?". I apoligize in advance.
* I enjoy hiking and basically anything with fresh air. Have done some amazing hikes from Seattle to New Hampshire.
* I love listening to podcasts and reading books, especially on topics related to history, tech, science, and food. Please give me book recs :)

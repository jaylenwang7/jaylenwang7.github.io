Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student in [CMU's ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) program working with [Prof. Akshitha Sriraman](https://akshithasriraman.eecs.umich.edu/). My research passion lies in finding novel ways to make cloud/web systems more sustainable by targeting more efficient use of datacenter resources (particularly hardware) in order to reduce carbon emissions, e-waste, and other environmental impacts from hyperscale systems.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from Harvard University (Class of 2022), where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

The best way to contact me is through email: `jaylenw [at] andrew.cmu.edu`

Hobbies/interests
======
* I've played tennis most of my life through college (in club tennis), and still playing (when I can).
* I'm a big fan of the NBA, particularly of the Boston Celtics. If there's a Celtics game on I'll probably be watching. If you also love Derrick White and Al Horford, we'll get along.
* I love making, talking about, and eating food. I may ask you questions such as "what fruit do you think is underrated?". I apoligize in advance.
* I enjoy hiking and basically anything with fresh air. Nothing like eating a PB&J when you reach the top.
* I love listening to podcasts and reading books of basically any genre. Please give me book recs :)

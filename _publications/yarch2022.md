We propose a novel resilience analysis framework targeting DNN accelerator design, which is critical for deployment in safety critical settings. Our proposed framework allows for resilience analysis that accounts for an accelerator's dataflow, which defines how data is moved within its memory hierarchy. We look to fill in the gaps of previous work that lack the capability to either account for the dataflow at all or to generalize to a diverse set of accelerator dataflows.
